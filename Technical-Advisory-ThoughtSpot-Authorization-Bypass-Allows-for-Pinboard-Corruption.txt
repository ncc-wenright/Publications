Product Description
~-----------------~
From ThoughtSpot's website [1]: "ThoughtSpot is a search & AI-driven analytics
platform for the enterprise. Anyone can use search to analyze company data in
seconds and get automated insights when you need them."


Vulnerability Overview
~--------------------~
In February 2019, VSR identified an authorization bypass vulnerability in
ThoughtSpot which allows any low-privilege user with write access to at least
one pinboard to corrupt arbitrary unauthorized pinboards belonging to any other
user. The vulnerability originates from a failure to verify user-supplied GUIDs
to ensure the requesting user is properly authorized to modify the associated
pinboard. This exploit requires a valid low-privilege user session to submit the
vulnerable request.


Vulnerability Details
~-------------------~
The ThoughtSpot application allows users to generate, visualize, and organize
analytics reports on company data. One method for viewing data is to organize
reports on pinboards to be shared with specific authorized users or groups.
However, the application fails to enforce authorization on pinboard update
requests, allowing a user to modify the ID of pinboards belonging to other users
without authorization. It does not appear possible for an attacker to gain
access to or modify a pinboard's contents in place. However, it is possible for
a low-privilege user to corrupt the original pinboard by spoofing GUIDs in
normal pinboard update requests. This prevents the original owner from accessing
the board and removes it from their view. An attacker could effectively corrupt
/ remove all pinboards from the application deployment, regardless of owner. 

An attacker would need access to a valid low-privilege user session with write
access to at least one pinboard in order to submit the vulnerable request and
target user pinboards. Therefore, administrators could review application logs
to identify malicious users. An attacker would also need to know the GUID
associated with any targeted pinboards. These GUIDs are revealed within API
responses during normal application use. Starting in version 5.1, the
application includes an optional setting which prevents GUIDs from being leaked
in responses to unauthorized requests.


Versions Affected
~---------------~
The issue was originally discovered in version 4.5.1.5, but exists starting in
version 4.4.1. The issue was fixed with the release of version 5.1.2.
